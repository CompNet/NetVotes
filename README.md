# Description
This set of R scripts was designed for two purposes:

1. Extract so-called *vote networks* from raw data describing the voting activity of a population.
2. Perform various analyses on these data, in particular: estimate good partitions of the network, according to different measures.

Our tool was applied to data representing the activity of the members of the European Parliament (MEPs) during the 7th term (from June 2009 to June 2014), as described in [MFLM'15]. The raw data describing this activity comes from the [VoteWatch](http://www.votewatch.eu/) website.


# Installation
1. Install the [`R` language](https://www.r-project.org/) and the [`igraph`](http://igraph.org/r/) package.
2. Download this project from GitHub.

This project contains the raw data for the 7th term MEPs activity, so it can be used as is. You can alternatively apply the scripts to other data, provided they follow the same structure and format. 


# Organization
Here are the folders composing the project:
* Folder `code`: contains the source code.
* Folder `input_files`: contains a collection of configuration files designed for the VoteWatch data. Each folder inside `input_files` correspond to a topic. Each topic folder contains one configuration file for each year of the considered term, and one for the whole term.
* Folder `output_files`: contains the file produced by our scripts. See the *Use* section for more details.
* Folder `parallel_ils_results`: contains the raw results of the ILS tool. This is an external algorithm able to estimate the optimal partition of the network nodes in terms of structural balance. It was applied to all the networks extracted by our scripts (from the VoteWatch data), and the produced files were placed here for postprocessing. Each subfolder corresponds to one of the topic-year pair. 
* Folder `votewatch_data`: the raw data extracted from the VoteWatch website.
  * `VoteWatch Europe European Parliament, Council of the EU.csv`: list of the documents voted during the considered term, with some details such as the date and topic.
  * `votes_by_document`: this folder contains a collection of CSV files, each one describing the outcome of the vote session relatively to one specific document.
  * `intermediate_files`: this folder contains several CSV files:
    * `allvotes.csv`: concatenation of all vote outcomes for all documents and all MEPS. Can be considered as a compact representation of the data contained in the folder `votes_by_document`.
    * `loyalty.csv`: same thing than `allvotes.csv`, but for the loyalty (i.e. whether or not the MEP voted like the majority of the MEPs in his political group).
    * `MPs.csv`: list of the MEPs having voted at least once in the considered term, with their details.
    * `policies.csv`: list of the topics considered during the term.
    * `qtd_docs.csv`: list of the topics with the corresponding number of documents.


# Use
In order to extract the networks from the raw data, compute certain statistics, apply the community detection methods, process their performance and generate various plots:

1. Open the `R` console.
2. Set the current directory as the working directory, using `setwd("<my directory>")`.
3. Run the main script `code/main.R`.

The script will produce the following files in the folder `output_files`:
* `agreement`: histograms representing the distributions of agreement and rebellion indices. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific topic.
* `community_algorithms_csv`: Performances obtained by the partitioning algorithms (for both community detection and correlation clustering). Each subfolder corresponds to a specific topic.
  * `xxxx_cluster_information.csv`: table containing several variants of the imbalance measure, for the considered algorithms.
* `community_algorithms_results`: Comparison of the partitions detected by the various algorithms considered, and distribution of the cluster/community sizes. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific topic.
  * `xxxx_cluster_comparison.csv`: table comparing the partitions detected by the community detection algorithms, in terms of Rand index and other measures.
  * `xxxx_ils_cluster_comparison.csv`: like `xxxx_cluster_comparison.csv`, except we compare the partition of community detection algorithms with that of the ILS.
  * `xxxx_yyyy_distribution.pdf`: histogram of the community (or cluster) sizes detected by algorithm `yyyy`.
* `graphs`: the networks extracted from the vote data. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific topic.
  * `xxxx_complete_graph.graphml`: network at the `Graphml` format, with all the information: nodes, edges, nodal attributes (including communities), weights, etc. 
  * `xxxx_edges_Gephi.csv`: only the links, with their weights (i.e. vote similarity). 
  * `xxxx_graph.g`: network at the `g` format (for ILS). 
  * `xxxx_net_measures.csv`: table containing some stats on the network (number of links, etc.).
  * `xxxx_nodes_Gephi.csv`: list of nodes (i.e. MEPs), with details.
  * `xxxx_infomap_community.txt`: membership vector generated by the application of the InfoMap algorithm.
  * `xxxx_multilevel_community.txt`: membership vector generated by the application of the Multi-Level algorithm.
  * `xxxx_fastgreedy_community.txt`: membership vector generated by the application of the FastGreedy algorithm.
  * `xxxx_walktrap_community.txt`: membership vector generated by the application of the Walktrap algorithm.

Note the ILS-related files are generated provided the ILS results have been placed in the `parallel_ils_results` folder.

In order to generate the plots from the paper, you additionally need to run the `code/chartsProcessor.R` script. The files are stored in the `output_files/plots` folder.
